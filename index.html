                        <p>Hello there üëã</p> 
                        <p>My name is¬†<b>Lo√Øc Lepinois</b>, and I am a <b>Front-end Engineer</b> from¬†Belgium. 
                            If you‚Äôre in a hurry, here is <a href="./LoicLepinoisResume2019.pdf" target="_blank">my resume</a>.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p>As you can see I really put huge effort into making this website, for a person who gets paid to make websites. But hey, <i>minimalism dude.</i></p>
                        <p>I studied Computer Science in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. First at <b>EPHEC</b>, and then at <b>UCL</b>. 
                            During that time, I was involved in multiple students project, such as <a href="https://carpestudentem.org/" target="_blank">CarpeStudentem</a>, 
                            and later, <b>Kot-√©-Rythmes</b>. 
                        I helped organized the <b>Welcome Spring! Festival</b>, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woPMb0lFqlM" target="_blank">2014</a> 
                        as the treasurer, and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTVzr2R1ANs" target="_blank">2015</a> as the booking agent.</p>

                            <p>Speaking of music, in 2013 I had the chance to intern at my favorite festival in the world, <a href="https://www.dourfestival.eu" target="_blank">Dour Festival</a>. 
                                I also make electronic music under the name of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mobuddy" target="_blank">Mobuddy</a>.</p>

                        <p>After school I worked for 3 years at <a href="http://www.skwarel.com" target="_blank">Skwarel</a>, as lead Front-end Engineer. 
                            Oh, by the way, they are <a href="https://www.skwarel.com/jobs/" target="_blank">recruiting</a>! 
                            After that I volunteered a few month in Vietnam for a french NGO called <a href="https://passerellesnumeriques.org" target="_blank">Passerelles Num√©riques</a>. 
                            They are <a href="https://www.passerellesnumeriques.org/en/join-us/" target="_blank">recruiting</a> aswell.</p>
