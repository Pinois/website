                        <p>Well hello there! What’s up? My name is <b>Loïc Lepinois</b>, and I am a <b>Front-end Engineer</b> from Belgium. 
                            As you can see I really put huge effort into this website, for a person who gets paid to make some. But hey, <i>minimalism bro</i>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Speaking of « getting to the point », that’s a space where I can brag a little bit and talk about me. 
                            Let’s get into that. If you’re in a hurry,  you can just check <a href="./LoicLepinoisResume2019.pdf" target="_blank">my resume here</a>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>So, I studied computer science in the lovely city of Louvain-la-Neuve, in Belgium. After completing my Bachelor degree at <b>EPHEC</b>, I tried the computer science Master at <b>UCL</b>, that I eventually never finished. 
                            Don’t get me wrong, I really liked machine learning, but the appeal of startups and design was stronger!
                        </p>
                        <p>After a quick trip around Europe, I move to Brussel and joined <a href="http://www.skwarel.com" target="_blank">Skwarel</a>, a startup which goal is to make accounting <i>sexy</i> (again?). Yeah, You read that right! 
                            During those amazing 3 years there, I really got the opportunity to cut my teeth on the Front-end side of things, and I eventually became the lead Front-end of the team. Oh, by the way, <a href="https://www.skwarel.com/jobs/" target="_blank">they are recruiting</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>My next challenge was abroad, in Vietnam precisely. I got the chance to volunteer for an amazing NGO called <a href="https://passerellesnumeriques.org" target="_blank">Passerelles Numériques</a>. 
                            They provides education and IT training to young underprivileged people in order to build their employability and allow them to escape poverty in a sustainable way. Pretty tight no?</p>
                        
                            <p>My role their was to mentor 3rd year students, during their final project in which they were allowed to build a business project, using whatever technology stack they wanted. 
                                So there was a lot of task management, mockups, debugging and other such fluffy stuff that the tech startup life offer. 
                                And it was amazing! You can help them by donations, but <a href="https://www.passerellesnumeriques.org/en/join-us/" target="_blank">they are also recruiting.</a></p>
                        <p>I'm currently looking for an volunteer position where I can help a non profit organisation with IT skills.
